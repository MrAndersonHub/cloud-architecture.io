Cloud Computing is:

>the **on-demand delivery** of compute power, storage, databases, applications, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other IT resources
over the **internet** with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

The term “Cloud” is generally used to encompass this technology, ecosystem of platforms and tools as well as ways-of-working and architectural approaches that make the best use of cloud technology. 

Cloud services should be "OSSM":

  * **On-demand:** services are available when requested, being provided in seconds/minutes not days and weeks
  * **Self-service:** users can create, manage and destroy resources themselves, often via an API
  * **Scalable:** users can choose the amount of resources they want, increasing and decreasing them in line with their needs
  * **Measurable:** service usage is measured and monitored supporting logging, auditability and cost management
  
Cloud is often described in terms of [IaaS]({{< ref "IaaS" >}}), [PaaS]({{< ref "PaaS" >}}) and [Serverless]({{< ref "Serverless" >}}).
