Cloud Computing brings the following benefits for organisations:

* **Focus on business value** Increase in focus on solving business problems instead of managing infrastructure
* **Organsiational Agility** Innovation and development cycles are sped up making the organisation more response to change and disruption. Fast provisioning of services enabling experimentation without large up-front costs
* **Resource Efficiency** Only pay for what you use, scaling up and down as business needs change increases efficiency, but does not necessarily reduce costs
* **High-level Architecture** the leading Cloud platforms offer consumable high-level services and capabilities around running code, artificial intelligence, queues, databses etc. These provide a set of bigger lego building blocks for creating new business value
*  **Immutable infrastructure** The ability to create clean repeatable environments for testing and deployment
*  **Automation** Automation of build, configuration, deployment, scaling and support via APIs
* **Compliance** The automation of infrastructure, means that changes to assets and data (intended or otherwise) are all logged improving security and compliance.
* **Democratisation of Infrastructure** Democratisation of large scale infrastructure as individuals can provision the sort of large scale resources that used to be only availabe to large enterprises
* **Democratisation of Innovation** Democratisation of vendors innovations in areas such as machine learning, analytics, automation, artificial intelligence etc.
* **Reduction in complexity** For large enterprises adoption of public cloud means a reduction in 2nd order complexity and costs of managing datacentres, cooling, safety etc.
