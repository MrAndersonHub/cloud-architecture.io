Welcome to **cloud-architecture.io**, a free resource about good development and architectural practices for Cloud. You can edit this page, and anything else on this site, it's all hosted as [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) on [github](https://github.com/macmike/cloud-architecture.io).

This site is brand new, so there's not much content yet!
